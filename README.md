# Heuristic Build Tool Comparison
## Dylan Bray (DB37299) and Alex Issa (api236)

Build tools are an important aspect of the software development ecosystem. Unfortunately, tools often rebuild code redundantly, wasting time, computational resources, and memory. We propose to evaluate different build tools on representative Java codebases, comparing their performance handling different types of changes in the codebase. This evaluation will consider Maven, Gradle, and Bazel - a new, high-performance tool that claims to handle incremental builds especially well. For expanded scope, Ant and Make may also be considered. We may also expand the scope of the project to consider different languages. The evaluation will compare each build tool’s speed, CPU usage, and memory usage, and may also consider the tools’ ability to scale with parallelization.
